#Part I:
question 1:
	a. x = 2 and y = 5?  x is  2
	b. x = 3 and y = 1?  Nothing
	c. x = 1 and y = 1?  x is  1
	d. x = 4 and y = 3?  z is  7

question 2:
	a. If x=3 and y = 5 then Y is equal to :  1
	b. If x=3 and y = 5 then Y is equal to :  1

question 3:
	Output  1 :  2
	Output  2 :  4
	Output  3 :  6
	Output  4 :  8
	Output  5 :  10

	Number of times is :  10

question 4:
	Nothing initially not greater than zero
